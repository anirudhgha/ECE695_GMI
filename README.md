Class project codes and other related files.

## Running the project
There are two files, each contain everything necessary to run the metropolis simulations on H20 and Alanine dipeptide. The codes are written on top of a package openmmtools, that itself sits on openmm. These are separately installable. The environment file for the conda environment is provided in the project folder. They can be installed separately following the links below as well.
